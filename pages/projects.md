Code

Often, I'll have at least two or three software developments on the go. Well, that's besides earning enough to keep myself fed and housed. I've had the pleasure of working with a lot of different technologies, applying them in various fields.

Languages I've used:

* Python (we're BFFs ‚ù§)
* C/C++
* Java
* JavaScript
* Matlab

For the code I write for pleasure, [my GitHub](https://github.com/vixus0/repositories) is a good start. Anything else will probably be discussed on the blog.
