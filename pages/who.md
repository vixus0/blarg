Who?

You know, I ask myself that same question sometimes. The simple answer is: I am a software developer based in London. I've written a lot of code in wildly varying settings. From physics sims and data analysis to getting a god-damn volume knob to work in MATLAB- wtf how can this be one of the hardest things I've ever attempted am I going to have to write a USB HID interface in python oh dear lor--

Anyway.. I am now working with my one true ‚ù§, the world wide web. Ok, bit of an exaggeration but you know I think I actually enjoy writing JavaScript -- I mean, come on who doesn't like putting that function in a function and passing it to a function? I do a bunch of the backend stuff too. Mainly in Python (Flask ftw). But I do Java stuff for Android and some game dev as a hobby. Hell, I could even write some C++ if I felt like it.

Honestly, if there's one thing I've learned it's that knowing a language is just one tiny part of being a developer. The actual important stuff you pick up can always be carried from one language to another. It's with you whether you're writing some enemy AI or a search engine.

 Speaking to people about your work is one of these skills. Especially if they aren't massive nerds, appreciative of fiiiine code. I'm good at discussing technical stuff with colleagues who don't have my background in dev. This is the stuff that makes me a good developer.

I hope to use this blog to discuss some interesting things with you, developer or not.
